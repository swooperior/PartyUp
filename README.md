# PartyUp
## Outline
A Node.js based solution for WoW Classic that allows players to create events, find group members for various content, advertise guilds and recruit members.

This is a passion project by Reece Mathieson, which if goes unused on deployment at least serves the purpose of being a valuble learning experience; pairing an Express Restful API back-end with a React.js Front-End.
